          <li>Does a movieâ€™s budget influence its box office performance?</li>
          <li>What is the evolution of total box office revenue from 2000 to 2023?</li>
          <li>How do top directors contribute to box office performance across various genres?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Like mentioned before this project is designed for film industry professionals, including directors, producers, and investors.
