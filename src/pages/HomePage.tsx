The sharp decline in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic highlights the industry's vulnerability to global events.

Top directors in these genres, such as James Cameron for Action and the Russo brothers for Adventure, show that well-known directors can boost box office success. Similarly, family films directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, and animated films by directors like Kyle Balda, highlight the financial potential of these genres. Even in Comedy, directors like Greta Gerwig show that this genre can achieve significant earnings. Overall, both the genre and the reputation of directors play crucial roles in attracting large audiences and driving box office earnings.",

These times coincide with school vacations and holidays, leading to higher movie attendance. Action, adventure and Animation are genres that dominate the box office, almost every month. Monthly revenue variations show lower earnings in January and February, an increase in March and April due to spring break, and a decline in August and September post-summer. October sees a slight uptick, maybe because of Halloween.",

Moderate-budget films ($150Mâ€“$300M) tend to break even or turn modest profits but rarely deliver exceptional ROI, as illustrated by titles like Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. High-budget films come with greater financial risk, though some notable exceptions, such as Avatar and Avengers: Endgame, manage to achieve both high revenue and strong ROI. Additionally, films like Joker highlight the potential for low-budget projects to generate significant financial success when paired with compelling storytelling and effective marketing strategies.",
